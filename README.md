# ðŸ§ª Polymer Curing Monitoring with ESP32 and Fermion Sensors

## Project Overview
This project uses an **ESP32 microcontroller** combined with a **3-sensor Fermion MEMS array** to non-destructively monitor the curing state of polymeric materials such as **epoxy** and **silicone**.  

By analysing the chemical fingerprint of VOC emissions during curing, the system can classify the materialâ€™s state in **real-time** without contact or sample destruction.

## Selected Sensor Array
The hardware supports three MEMS sensors, optimised for polymer curing detection:

| Sensor | Target | Role |
|--------|--------|------|
| Alcohol / Ketone Sensor | Ethanol, Acetone | Tracks VOCs released during initial curing phase |
| Formaldehyde (HCHO) Sensor | Aldehydes, amines | Detects curing agents and early chemical reactions |
| VOC / MQ-135 Type Sensor | Miscellaneous organics | Captures residual VOCs for full chemical fingerprint |

> Together, these sensors provide a **multi-dimensional signal** suitable for machine learning classification.

## Hardware Setup
- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Reads analog sensor outputs, logs data, and streams if needed.  
- **Test Chamber**: Small, sealed container (e.g., 500 mL) to accumulate VOCs.  
- **Power Supply**: Stable 5V for sensors and ESP32.  
- **Data Logging**: SD card or Wi-Fi streaming for recorded VOC patterns.

**Wiring Notes**:
- Connect each sensor output to an **analog input** on the ESP32.  
- Include baseline readings in clean air for normalisation.  
- Maintain stable temperature and humidity for consistent readings.

## Software and Data Pipeline
1. **Sensor Readings**
   - Acquire analog voltages every 1â€“5 seconds.  
   - Convert to resistance ratios or normalised voltages relative to baseline.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Normalize each sensor output: \( R_S / R_0 \) or scaled voltage.  
   - Optional: apply moving average for noise reduction.

3. **Machine Learning Classification**
   - Multi-class classification: `[Uncured, Transition, Fully Cured, Degrading]`.  
   - Algorithms:
     - Baseline: **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** or **Random Forest**  
     - Deep Learning: **Feed-Forward Neural Network (FNN)** for complex patterns  

4. **Output**
   - Real-time display on OLED or logging to SD card.  
   - Optional alerts when material reaches specific curing state.

## Usage Notes
- Allow **sensor warm-up** before logging (e.g., 30 min).  
- Use a **small sealed chamber** to concentrate VOCs.  
- **Calibrate baseline readings** in clean air.  
- **Machine learning is recommended**; single sensor trends may be insufficient for accurate classification.
