ðŸ§ª Materials Engineering and Machine Learning Synthesis for Non-Destructive Chemical State Assessment (M-LENS)
Project Overview
M-LENS (Materials-informed Localized Electronic Nose System) is an interdisciplinary project that bridges Materials Engineering, low-cost Electronics, and Machine Learning (ML) to perform non-destructive, real-time chemical state monitoring of materials.

The goal is to demonstrate that the curing state or early degradation of a polymeric material can be accurately classified by analyzing the unique chemical "fingerprint" of its volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions using a simple array of Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors (an "Electronic Nose").

This project showcases expertise in:

Materials Characterization: Understanding material kinetics and chemical pathways that lead to VOC release.

Low-Cost Electronics: Interfacing analog sensors with digital microcontrollers for reliable data acquisition.

Machine Learning/Deep Learning: Implementing predictive classification models for multi-dimensional sensor data.

1. Materials Engineering Principle
The foundation of this project relies on Material Curing Kinetics and Chemical Off-Gassing.

When a thermoset polymer (like epoxy or silicone) cures, it undergoes a chemical reaction (polymerization and cross-linking) that converts it from a liquid to a solid. During this process, or as it begins to degrade, it releases specific VOCs.

The Signature: The concentration and composition of these VOCs change predictably as the reaction progresses. An array of non-specific MOS sensors provides a unique multi-dimensional signal (a "chemical fingerprint") at each stage of the material's life.

The Metric (Feature): The primary feature extracted from the sensors is the normalized resistance ratio (R_S / R_0), where:

R 
S
â€‹
 : Sensor resistance in the presence of the Material Under Test (MUT).

R 
0
â€‹
 : Sensor resistance in clean air (baseline).

By tracking the vector of R_S / R_0 values across the sensor array over time, we capture the transition of the material's chemical state.

2. Hardware and Electronics Setup
The sensor array and data logger are designed for simplicity and low power consumption (although the ML model is run offline in this demonstration).

Data Acquisition Flow
Each MOS sensor is connected to an analog input (ADC) pin on the ESP32 via a simple voltage divider circuit.

The ESP32 reads the voltage V

3. Data Acquisition & ML/DL Pipeline
3.1 Data Collection Strategy
The system requires labeled data representing different material states.

State Label

Description

Data Collection Method

State 1: Liquid/Uncured

Initial mixing phase.

Log data for the first hour post-mixing.

State 2: Gelling/Transition

Viscosity rapidly increasing.

Log data between 1-5 hours post-mixing.

State 3: Fully Cured/Stable

Final solid state (Endpoint).

Log data after 24 hours, continuing for several days.

State 4: Degradation

Simulated failure state.

Expose a fully cured sample to deliberate degradation (e.g., mild heat or chemical stress) and log the new fingerprint.

3.2 Machine Learning Implementation
The objective is a Multi-Class Classification task: given a sensor vector X = [R_S/R_0 (MQ2), R_S/R_0 (MQ3), ...], predict the corresponding State Label.

Toolkit
Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn (for data preprocessing, model training), matplotlib (for visualization), TensorFlow/Keras (optional, for Deep Learning).

Model Selection
Preprocessing: Normalize the input features (e.g., using StandardScaler).

Model 1 (Baseline): Support Vector Machine (SVM) or Random Forest Classifier. These are powerful, interpretable models ideal for relatively small, well-separated feature spaces like this one.

Model 2 (Deep Learning Showcase): Feed-Forward Neural Network (FNN). This demonstrates the use of Deep Learning to learn complex, non-linear boundaries between the material states in the multi-dimensional sensor space.
