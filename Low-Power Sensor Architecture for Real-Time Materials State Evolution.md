# Low-Power Sensor Architecture and ML Synthesis for Real-Time Polymer State Evolution

---

## Project Motivation
This project was born out of the **limitations in current industrial material assessment**, which often relies on costly, intermittent methods:

### 1. The Blind Spot of Intermittency
Most **Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE)** techniques are still **manual and periodic**.  
During the gaps between inspections, critical transformations in polymers can occur unnoticed, such as:  
- Micro-crack initiation  
- Rapid changes in curing rate  
- Early-stage chemical degradation (e.g. thermal, photo-oxidative, or hydrolytic)  

These events may progress silently and lead to **unexpected failures** if not continuously monitored.

### 2. The Cost of Maintenance
Because maintenance is usually **time-based**, industries face two costly outcomes:  
- Premature replacement of components that are still functional  
- Excessive labour from unnecessary manual inspections  

### 3. The Inaccuracy of Modelling
Degradation models built in **lab-controlled environments** rarely capture the stochastic, real-world conditions polymers are exposed to.  
To make **true predictive maintenance possible**, **continuous, real-time field data** is essential.

üëâ My project addresses these flaws by creating a system that is **always present, always measuring, and intelligently reporting**. This shifts maintenance strategies from **reactive or preventive** to **precise, condition-based approaches**.

## My Innovation: An Autonomous, Edge-AI Solution
I am developing a **Low-Power Sensor Architecture** that continuously assesses polymer condition throughout its service life.  

### Key Features of My System:
- Continuous monitoring of **polymer health and curing behaviour**  
- Integration of **gas-sensitive and non-destructive sensing hardware** with **on-device ML (Edge-AI)**  
- Ability to ‚Äúsniff‚Äù **volatile organic compounds (VOCs)** and other gaseous by-products associated with **polymer curing, degradation, or ageing**  
- **Immediate, local data interpretation** without relying on the cloud  
- Significantly reduced **data bandwidth** and **power consumption**  
- Designed for **autonomous IoT deployment**

## Tracking Polymer State Evolution
The system‚Äôs main utility is to capture **Polymer State Evolution**:

### üîπ Curing Assessment
- My ML models provide **real-time validation of polymer curing progress**  
- Ensures that required physical properties are achieved  
- Removes guesswork from **manufacturing quality control**  

### üîπ Degradation Analysis
- Detects subtle chemical and structural changes linked to:  
  - Thermal degradation  
  - Oxidative/photo-oxidative ageing  
  - Hydrolytic breakdown  
- Identifies characteristic **gas/VOC signatures** released during these processes  
- Provides **early warnings** of material decline

## Project Impact
Through this work, I am creating a **robust, energy-efficient framework** for **autonomous polymer sensing**.  

This project will enable:  
- **Lifecycle optimization** for polymer-based materials  
- **Greater reliability** of engineered systems  
- A shift from reactive maintenance to **intelligent, predictive monitoring**  

‚ö° My project aims to redefine how industries monitor and manage polymers‚Äîbringing **continuous intelligence** and **gas-sensing capabilities** into the core of sustainable, reliable material design.
