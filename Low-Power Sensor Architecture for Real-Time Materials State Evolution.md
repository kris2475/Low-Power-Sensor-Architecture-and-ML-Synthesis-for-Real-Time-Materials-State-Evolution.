# Low-Power Sensor Architecture and ML Synthesis for Real-Time Materials State Evolution

---

## Project Motivation
This project was born out of the **limitations in current industrial material assessment**, which often relies on costly, intermittent methods:

### 1. The Blind Spot of Intermittency
Most **Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE)** techniques are still **manual and periodic**.  
During the gaps between inspections, critical events such as:
- Micro-crack formation  
- Corrosion onset  
- Rapid curing deceleration  

...can occur unnoticed, potentially leading to **unexpected failures**.

### 2. The Cost of Maintenance
Because maintenance is usually **time-based**, industries face two costly outcomes:
- Premature replacement of components that are still functional  
- Excessive labor from unnecessary manual inspections  

### 3. The Inaccuracy of Modelling
Degradation models built in **controlled lab settings** rarely reflect the randomness of **real-world stressors**.  
To make **true predictive maintenance possible**, **continuous, real-time field data** is essential.

ðŸ‘‰ My project addresses these flaws by creating a system that is **always present, always measuring, and intelligently reporting**. This shifts maintenance strategies from **reactive or preventive** to **precise, condition-based approaches**.

## My Innovation: An Autonomous, Edge-AI Solution
I am developing a **Low-Power Sensor Architecture** that continuously assesses material condition throughout its service life.  

### Key Features of My System:
- Continuous monitoring of **long-term health** and **short-term quality**  
- Integration of **non-destructive sensing hardware** with **on-device ML (Edge-AI)**  
- **Immediate, localized data interpretation** without relying on the cloud  
- Significantly reduced **data bandwidth** and **power consumption**  
- Designed for **autonomous IoT deployment**

## Tracking Materials State Evolution
The systemâ€™s main utility is to capture **Materials State Evolution**:

### ðŸ”¹ Curing Assessment
- My ML models deliver **real-time validation of curing progress**  
- Ensures that required physical properties are reached  
- Removes guesswork from **manufacturing quality control**  

### ðŸ”¹ Degradation Analysis
- Detects subtle chemical and structural shifts linked to:  
  - Fatigue  
  - Corrosion  
  - Ageing  
- Provides **early warnings** before failures occur

## Project Impact
Through this work, I am creating a **robust, energy-efficient framework** for **autonomous sensing**.  

This project will enable:  
- **Lifecycle optimization** for materials  
- **Greater reliability** of engineered systems  
- A transition from reactive fixes to **intelligent, predictive maintenance**  

âš¡ My project aims to redefine how industries monitor and manage materialsâ€”bringing **continuous intelligence** to the heart of sustainability and reliability.
